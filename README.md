## ‚ö† Notice

Since I have already migrated my note from hexo to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the development progress may be slow down in the future. If you want to add more features to this theme, fill free to fork and modify it by yourself. Though I will not put a lot efforts in this project, any suggestions are still welcome.

However, I suggest that you should try hugo first before using hexo (if you never used both). Hugo is writen by go-lang, and it is faster, powerful and lighter than hexo in my opinion. After doing some research, I realized that hugo can meet all of my requirements and also provide a more logical way to customize a theme at the same time which is amazing, you guys should give it a try!

## üíø Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kaiiiz/hexo-theme-book.git themes/book
```

If you don't have scss renderer, follow this:

```
npm install hexo-renderer-scss --save
```

Modify `theme` entry in `_config.yml`

```
theme: book
```

### Change markdown renderer

For better render quality, I suggest that you should change the default renderer.

The detail, see [change markdown renderer](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hexo-theme-book/wiki/Change-markdown-renderer)

## üéà Update

Jump into the theme folder, run `git pull`. If you use `/source/_data/book.yml`, please note the diffrence of updated `_config.yml`.

### Smooth Update

For smoothly updating, I recommand to create a config file named `book.yml` in `/source/_data` folder (If it doesn't exist, create one)

> **Notice: source folder is under your hexo working directory, not the theme one!**

Copy the contents of `/themes/book/_config.yml` to `/source/_data/book.yml`, it will replace the contents of config in `/themes/book/_config.yml`. Now you can configure it independently and also, you can update theme more smoothly.

## ‚öí Configurations

The detail of config, see [Configurations](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hexo-theme-book/wiki/Configuration)
